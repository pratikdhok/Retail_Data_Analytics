Here are some business KPI examples 
1)Annual Product Revenue:
Calculate the total revenue generated by each product category for each year to understand the contribution of different products
to the overall revenue.
Possible_sql query:

SELECT
    YEAR(sale_date) AS sales_year,
    product_id,
    SUM(amount) AS total_revenue,
    LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER(PARTITION BY product_id ORDER BY YEAR(sale_date)) AS prev_year_revenue
FROM
    sales
GROUP BY
    sales_year,
    product_id
ORDER BY
    product_id,
    sales_year;

3)Product Revenue Distribution:
Determine the percentage of total revenue that each product category contributes for each year, helping to prioritize product 
strategies.
Possible sql query

ORDER BY
    sales_year;

5)Seasonal Revenue Patterns:
Observe revenue trends for each product category across different seasons to adapt inventory, marketing, and pricing strategies
 accordingly.
possible sql query:
SELECT
    YEAR(sale_date) AS sales_year,

JOIN
    products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY
    sales_year,
    s.product_id
ORDER BY
    sales_year,
    s.product_id;

7)Market Share by Revenue:

    s.product_id,
    SUM(s.amount) AS product_revenue,
    tmr.total_market_revenue,
    SUM(s.amount) / tmr.total_market_revenue AS market_share
FROM
    sales s
JOIN
    TotalMarketRevenue tmr ON s.sales_year = tmr.sales_year
GROUP BY
    s.sales_year,
    s.product_id,
    tmr.total_market_revenue
ORDER BY
    s.sales_year,
    s.product_id;


8)New Product Contribution:
Track the revenue generated by new product introductions for each year to measure their success and impact on overall revenue.

    FROM
        sales
    GROUP BY
        product_id

WHERE
    s.sale_date >= np.introduction_date
GROUP BY
    sales_year,
    np.product_id
ORDER BY
    sales_year,

    SUM(s.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM
    churn c
JOIN
    sales s ON c.product_id = s.product_id AND YEAR(c.churn_date) = YEAR(s.sale_date)
